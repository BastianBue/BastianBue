Greetings! I'm Bastian BÃ¼ld, a 23-year-old programming enthusiast who discovered my love for coding amidst the chaos of the pandemic. 
This revelation led me to a profound passion for frontend development, prompting a wholehearted career shift. 

One of my current endeavors involves the development of a Frontend (FE) component library, alongside my incredible Team. This library, crafted in TypeScript and utilizing the React library, is a cornerstone of our project, shared by our diverse team of over 50 individuals. Notably, this includes at least 15 frontend developers who actively contribute to and benefit from its functionalities.

What makes this task particularly gratifying for me is the exposure to challenges that extend beyond conventional application development. Developing a shared component library brings about unique complexities, requiring a deep understanding of collaborative development and user experience design.
